## THE BOARD SPACES

### PROPERTIES

There are three types of properties: **Streets** (which come in color sets), **Railroads**, and **Utilities**.

#### Landing on an Unowned Property

When you land on an unowned property, you have two choices:

**Option 1: Buy It**
- Pay the price shown on the board space
- Take the Title Deed card from the Bank

**Option 2: Decline to Buy**
- If **Auction Mode is ON** (default): The Banker must immediately auction the property
- If **Auction Mode is OFF**: The property remains with the Bank and can be purchased on a future turn when someone lands on it

#### Auctions (when Auction Mode is enabled)

1. Banker offers the property starting at £10
2. Any player can bid, increasing by as little as £1
3. Players don't need to follow turn order
4. Banker ends the auction when no one will increase the bid
5. Highest bidder pays the Bank and receives the Title Deed
6. If no one bids, the property stays with the Bank

#### Landing on an Owned Property

When you land on property owned by another player:
- **Rent is collected automatically and immediately**
- You must pay the rent amount shown on the Title Deed card
- Exception: If **No Rent in Jail** is enabled and the owner is in Jail, no rent is due

- 2 Utilities owned: Rent = 10× dice roll

---

- This includes passing GO on your way to any space

#### Free Parking

## JAIL RULES

### Going to Jail

- You CAN still make deals and trades

### Getting Out of Jail

You have three options:

**Option 1: Pay £50**

- Then roll and move normally

**Option 2: Use a "Get Out of Jail Free" card**

---

## BUILDINGS

### Buying Houses

Once you own all Streets in a color set, you can buy Houses:

**Requirements:**
- Own the complete color set
- No Street in the color set can be mortgaged
- **Must be done on your turn** (not between turns)
- Pay the House cost shown on the Title Deed card to the Bank
- Place the House on the Street

**Building Rules:**

**If "Even Build" is ON (default):**
- You must build evenly across the color set
- You cannot place a second House on any Street until all Streets in the set have one House
- You cannot place a third House on any Street until all Streets have two Houses
- Maximum 4 Houses per Street

**If "Even Build" is OFF:**
- You can build Houses in any order on Streets in the color set
- Maximum 4 Houses per Street

### Buying Hotels

Once you have 4 Houses on **all** Streets in a color set:
- Pay the Hotel cost shown on the Title Deed card
- Return all 4 Houses from that Street to the Bank
- Place 1 Hotel on that Street
- Maximum 1 Hotel per Street
- No additional Houses can be added once a Hotel is built

### Building Shortages

**If "Unlimited Properties" is OFF (default):**

The game includes a limited supply of 32 Houses and 12 Hotels.

If multiple players want to buy the last available House or Hotel:
1. The Banker auctions it
2. Bidding starts at £10
3. Anyone can increase by as little as £1
4. Players don't need to follow turn order
5. Payment goes to the Bank
6. Winner receives the building

If no buildings are available, you must wait until another player sells buildings back to the Bank.

**Strategic Note:** Creating building shortages is a legitimate tactic. Some players intentionally build 4 Houses on all properties in a color set and avoid upgrading to Hotels, preventing opponents from building.

**If "Unlimited Properties" is ON:**

There is no limit to the number of Houses and Hotels available. Players can always purchase buildings as long as they meet the requirements and can afford them. Use substitute tokens (coins, paper, etc.) to represent additional buildings beyond the physical pieces included with the game.

---

## MORTGAGING PROPERTY

### Mortgage Mode ON (Default)

**To Mortgage a Property:**
1. Sell all buildings in its color set to the Bank for half their purchase price
2. Turn the Title Deed card face down
3. Collect the mortgage value (printed on back of card) from the Bank

**While Mortgaged:**
- No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties
- Rent CAN still be collected on unmortgaged properties in the same color set (at increased rates if you own the set)
- Same applies to Railroads and Utilities

**To Unmortgage:**
- Pay the unmortgage cost to the Bank: mortgage value + 10%
- Turn the Title Deed card face up
- Property can now collect rent again

### Mortgage Mode OFF

**Alternative: Selling Properties to the Bank**
- You cannot mortgage properties
- Instead, you can sell any property back to the Bank for half its printed purchase price
- The property returns to the Bank and becomes available for purchase again when someone lands on it
- All buildings must still be sold back first before selling a Street

---

## DEALS & TRADES

You can negotiate with other players at any time:

**What Can Be Traded:**
- Cash
- Properties (mortgaged or unmortgaged)
- Get Out of Jail Free cards

**Trading Rules:**
- Players decide the terms of any deal
- You must sell all buildings on a color set back to the Bank before trading away any Street in that set
- You cannot trade buildings themselves to other players
- Mortgaged properties can be traded at any agreed price

**When Trading Mortgaged Property:**

The new owner must immediately choose to either:
1. **Repay the mortgage:** Pay the unmortgage cost (mortgage value + 10%) to the Bank
2. **Keep the mortgage:** Pay 10% interest on the mortgage value to the Bank now, pay full unmortgage cost later

**Loans and Immunity Deals:**
- Players MAY loan money to each other at any agreed terms
- Players MAY make deals for rent immunity or reduced rent
- All deals are binding once agreed upon by both parties

**Selling Buildings:**
1. Sell Hotels to the Bank for half their purchase price
   - Exchange them immediately for 4 Houses

### ⚙️ SPEED DIE (Advanced Variant)
**Default: OFF**

**When ON, add a special third die with the following faces:**
- Three faces showing "1", "2", "3"
- Two faces showing "Mr. Monopoly"
- One face showing "Bus"

#### Speed Die Rules:

**When to Use:**
- All players must have passed GO at least once before the Speed Die is introduced
- Once all players have passed GO, the Speed Die is used for the remainder of the game

**Rolling:**
- Roll all three dice together
- Add the numbers from all three dice for your movement (treat Mr. Monopoly as 0 when adding)

**Mr. Monopoly Face:**
If you roll Mr. Monopoly:
1. Move using the total of the two regular dice
2. After completing your move on that space, move to the next unowned property
   - If no unowned properties exist, move to the next property where you owe rent
   - If you don't owe rent anywhere, your turn ends normally
3. Execute the action on the space where you finally land

**Bus Face:**
If you roll the Bus:
1. You may use the number from either die (your choice), ignoring the other
2. Useful for landing on specific spaces or avoiding dangerous ones

**Doubles with Speed Die:**
- Doubles occur when both regular dice show the same number
- The Speed Die doesn't affect doubles
- Rolling three regular doubles still sends you to Jail

**Going to Jail:**
- If any roll sends you to Jail, ignore all other dice results
- Your turn ends immediately
- Mr. Monopoly and Bus effects are ignored

**Triple Rolls:**
- If all three dice show the same number (1-1-1, 2-2-2, or 3-3-3), move that total and immediately move again to the next unowned/rent-owed property, then your turn ends (you don't get another full turn)

#### Speed Die Strategy Tips:
- Mr. Monopoly accelerates property acquisition early in the game
- Bus provides tactical positioning control
- Game length typically reduced by 30-50%
- Increases pace without changing core mechanics
- Rent collection becomes more frequent

---

## STRATEGY TIPS

**For Faster Games:**
- Use Auction Mode ON
- Start with lower cash amounts
- Enforce immediate rent collection
- Consider Speed Die variant
- Enable Unlimited Properties to prevent building stalemates

**Property Priority:**
- Orange properties (most landed-on due to Jail positioning)
- Red properties (high rent, frequently landed)
- Railroads (consistent income, no building required)
- Dark blue and green (highest rents but harder to reach)

**Building Strategy:**
- Three Houses is optimal rent-to-cost ratio on most properties
- With Unlimited Properties OFF: Create building shortages to block opponents
- With Unlimited Properties ON: Focus on rapid development since shortages aren't possible
- Build on orange/red before expensive properties

**Economic Management:**
- Keep cash reserves for unexpected rent payments
- Don't overbuild if it leaves you cash-poor
- Trade aggressively to complete color sets
- Mortgage strategically to fund crucial purchases
